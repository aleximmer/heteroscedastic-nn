## Setup
Requires installation of `python>=3.8` with an up-to-date version of pytorch.
Additional online dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt` and have to be installed with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
Further, `dependencies/` contain modified versions of [`laplace-torch`](https://github.com/aleximmer/Laplace) and [`asdl`](https://github.com/kazukiosawa/asdl) and have to be installed with `pip install -e dependencies/laplace` and `pip install -e dependencies/asdl`.
To install local utilities, run `pip install -e .` in the root directory of this repository.

## Example Usage

A simple example using an MLP on the Skafte data set can be found in `plot_skafte_example.py`.
It reproduces the first figure in the paper comparing homoscedastic to heteroscedastic regression and additionally showing the epistmic uncertainty given by the respective Laplace approximations.

## Implementation Details
We extended laplace-torch to support (natural) heteroscedastic Gaussian likelihoods and asdl to support their Fisher/GGN curvature approximations as described in the paper.
The modifications can be found in `dependencies/`.
Laplace requires the natural parameterization of the likelihood for positie semidefiniteness of the Hessian as described in the paper.
To accomplish this, the two outputs have to be `[eta_1, eta_2]` as in `hetreg.models.NaturalHead`.
To use an existing mean-variance parameterized network, the `hetreg.models.NaturalReparamHead` can be applied and transforms the outputs accordingly.
The remaining code is for the experiments and figures in the paper.
To use the proposed rotated image regression datasets, see `hetreg/image_datasets.py` and their use in `run_image_regression.py`.

## Reproducing Experiments

Image, UCI, and CRISPR regression commands can be generated by `python commands/jobs_image_generate.py`, `python commands/jobs_uci_generate.py`, and `python commands/jobs_crispr_generate.py` respectively, which also serve as examples for running our method.
For example, `python commands/jobs_image_generate.py > jobs.sh` generates the commands for image regression line-by-line so they can be submitted to a scheduler.
Alternatively, an example is shown in `plot_skafte_example.py` for the toy example visualizations used in the paper.
Both rely on the corresponding scripts `run_image_regression.py` and `run_uci_crispr_egression.py` to be run and save results to wandb.
The result tables can then be obtained by aggregation on the wandb frontend or downloading results from the API.
For the CRISPR-Cas-13 datasets we use, we are thankful to the authors of [previous work](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v206/stirn23a/stirn23a.pdf) for having shared the datasets.
